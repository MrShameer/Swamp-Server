    			Swamp Cinema is a casual, social gamemode where players hang out in a virtual movie theater and watch videos. On ours, there's lots of fun stuff to do outside of the theaters. Start a game of chess, checkers, golf, or dodgeball. Or save up your pointshop points, pick up some weapons, and start a war!

    			<br/>IMAGE<br>
    			Swamp Cinema's popularity comes from both it's lightweight initial downloads,
				and it's addictive, constantly growing playerbase who keep coming back for more chaotic fun.

    			<h1>Special Locations</h1>

    			The Underworld
    			Hang out with your pony friends in this human-free zone

    			(Warning: you cannot accept teleport requests
    			in this place unless you have your own separate theater there).



    			Trump Tower
    			Relax in the Trump Tower lobby thanks to the talented piano players.
    			Try out your chess and checkers skills against other players!
    			There is an elevator that will take you up
    			the 4 other floors in which you can setup
    			your very own theaters or gamble your points at the arcade!

    			The Movie Theater
    			The Movie Theater is the main space for movie nights. This is a safe zone where
    			everyone can sit down and relax without having to worry about getting killed.

    			It is also the place where a lot of players choose to AFK, therefore, you will
    			rarely be able to vote-skip videos due to the sheer amount of players in this theater.


    			The Knife Pit
    			Try out your melee skills in this pvp-specific arena located right outside of the main lobby.

    			Warning, this is not for the faint of heart, as there are quite a lot of talented players
    			around the server that know many ways of killing, even with just a knife.



    			The Moon
    			The rocket in the center of the pit will take you up to the moon, which is a special place where players can relax in a confined and sealed theater



    			The Mines
    			The mines are filled with diamond ore thirsty players swinging their pickaxes.

    			Here, you can mine for points, or gather some blocks and build whatever you desire.

    			You will find the portal to the underworld somewhere within the depths of the mines.
