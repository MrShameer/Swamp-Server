				Swamp Cinema is a casual, social gamemode where players hang out in a virtual movie theater and watch videos. On ours, there's lots of fun stuff to do outside of the theaters. Start a game of chess, checkers, golf, or dodgeball. Or save up your pointshop points, pick up some weapons, and start a war!

				<h2>The Underworld</h2>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477808325749/F5C0E0D065328B44F4194A1792094691137AF1B3/" title="Underworld">

				</a>
				<br>

				Hang out with your pony friends in this human-free zone

				(Warning: you cannot accept teleport requests
				in this place unless you have your own separate theater there).

				<br>
				<h2>Trump Tower</h2>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1494586001114616397/B1D388358B70354E8ABE0732C31430ACEDBF13AF/" title="Trump Tower">

				</a>
				<br>
				Relax in the Trump Tower lobby thanks to the talented piano players.
				Try out your chess and checkers skills against other players!
				There is an elevator that will take you up
				the 4 other floors in which you can setup
				your very own theaters or gamble your points at the arcade!

				<h2>The Movie Theater</h2>
				
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1662353909238878150/0C5AD5F0E809CB4529917DD5AADE2CCE178331F7/" title="Movie Theater">

				</a>
				<br>
				
				The Movie Theater is the main space for movie nights. This is a safe zone where
				everyone can sit down and relax without having to worry about getting killed.

				It is also the place where a lot of players choose to AFK, therefore, you will
				rarely be able to vote-skip videos due to the sheer amount of players in this theater.

				<h2>The Knife Pit</h2>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1494586001114626137/B752C9D2208951337424F4916EBE87F3584BAA7E/" title="Knife Pit">

				</a>
				<br>
				

				Try out your melee skills in this pvp-specific arena located right outside of the main lobby.

				Warning, this is not for the faint of heart, as there are quite a lot of talented players
				around the server that know many ways of killing, even with just a knife.

				<h2>The Moon</h2>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477808355697/073531B6A3281512AD002541E4692372A236C34F/" title="Moon">

				</a>
				<br>

				The rocket in the center of the pit will take you up to the moon, which is a special place where players can relax in a confined and sealed theater

				<h2>The Mines</h2>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1494586001114589757/DBE544AD1A462CF4B959831F3ACE6D35CB053499/" title="Mines">

				</a>
				<br>

				The mines are filled with diamond ore thirsty players swinging their pickaxes.

				Here, you can mine for points, or gather some blocks and build whatever you desire.

				You will find the portal to the underworld somewhere within the depths of the mines.

			Swamp Cinema requires a few steps to be done first to ensure full functionality.
			<div class="in">
				<h1>Initial Steps</h1>
				You need to make sure that you are on the x86-64 - Chromium + 64-bit binaries beta for Garry's Mod and that the Garry's Mod: CEF Codec Fix is applied to your game.

				The steps to do this are listed by pressing F2 while on the server.
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1494586001116293038/490EE3577A45068B2E3813CBF420F44E497408D3/" title="Initial Steps">

				</a>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class="in">
				<h1>Queuing Videos</h1>
				Once those 2 steps correctly done, the server will offer you so many possibilities
				that you will probably not find elsewhere, in terms of watching videos on a gmod server.
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477807747599/0372E081AFF329A58700544F820B87F50796FCA3/" title="Queuing Videos">

				</a>
				<br>

				These options involve YouTube's entire spectrum of functionalities including it's HTML5 videos and YouTube livestreams.

				(Thanks to the codecs patch made by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/WinterPhoenix96" target="_blank">WinterPhoenix96</a> , who is known to be the Lead Developer behind the Yuki Cinema Server)
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1494586001116329634/3086FFA24E4892F9B7DF1B8C7F02B51B4CE75FD1/" title="Queuing Videos">

				</a>
				<br>

				If these are not enough, there are also possibilities of queuing videos from different hosting services such as:

				-Twitch,
				-Dropbox,
				-RTMP servers.

		</div>
		

		<span class="hide" id="Rtmp"></span>
		<div>
			<div class="divi">RTMP Server</div>
			<div class="in">
				RTMP Servers can bring you alot of flexibility , but at a certain cost.
				You will first need to rent an Ubuntu 18 machine hosted by a service like:
				-digitalocean
				-arubacloud

				Which will both enable you to Livestream and Play large .mp4 files
				as illustrated in the following graphs :

				<br><br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477809001398/1C3629B18F209A097D6B2C498D6C28DBA3263178/" title="Queuing Videos">

				</a>
				<br><br>

				Make sure to follow the server's rules when queuing content from both rtmp and Dropbox since they do not have a regulation like the Twitch and YouTube.

				If you have any doubts, please ask a staff member for clarification
				on the subject before queuing the content.

			<div class="in">
				What makes Swamp Cinema so popular and addicting is not just its advanced media system;
				it's also the side-activities every player can take part in once they no longer feel like watching videos. Listed below are various way to earn, spend, and gamble points.

				<h1>The Pointshop</h1>
				The pointshop can be opened by typing !shop or by pressing F3. Points are earned just by playing on the server. One of the more popular methods of earning points is to stay connected to the server, even while not actively playing. You can see how many points you earn every minute in the bottom left corner of the pointshop. This is where you will be able to buy various items such as:
				Toys, Weapons, Construction-based items, Playermodels, or Swag items.

				Golfing is a very simple way to initially make points when you start on the server.

				<h1>Gambling</h1>
				<h2>Rolling</h2>
				Gambling is also a part of the server in a multitude of ways.
				The most simple form of gambling available to the players on the server is the rolling system.

				To win a roll, you must get dubs. This means having the last two digits of the randomized number be exactly the same. If you win, your reward is your bet multiplied by 10.

				Otherwise, your points are lost. It is also possible to get trips, quads, quints or even sexts, by matching more than just the last 2 digits. These won't give you an extra reward, but it does look cool.
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477807607910/D08A8DF60082C7A36AA4871D568320EABE9B7031/" title="Rolling">

				<h1>'KEK' Temple</h1>
				The KEK Temple is an underground place you will discover while exploring the labyrinth, if you don't know where the labyrinth is.. you can find the entrance in the Sewer Tunnels, Minecraft, the Trumppenbunker, and Kleiner's Teleportation Portal.

				An Idol will spawn once every hour, and upon collecting it, you'll have 100 seconds to traverse through the labyrinth back onto the surface. The maze doesn't change so the easy way to do this is to pre-emptively map out the maze to find the fastest route.

				You will receive 100,000 points upon successful completion, however if time runs out, the idol will crumble to dust!

				<h1>Chatting with friends</h1>

				Either through global chat (team chat , pressing U) or local chats (pressing Y).

				<h2>Emotes</h2>
				Submitted emotes are more likely to be accepted if they can be used often and are less than 200x200.
				png and gif formats are often preferred, because they both allow transparency.
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477807424556/DB0D9738F6BDBB65C7000621E150BB5212BB91B3/" title="Emotes">

				<h2>Sound Emotes</h2>
				Typing certain words or phrases into chat will play a sound.

				A list can be found by clicking the emoji at he bottom right of your chat frame and clicking on <b>"Sounds"</b>
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1497964473147481001/4886923878D1525811E1B157436D46F9944F8BCF/" title="Sound Emotes">

				</a>

				<h2>Images</h2>
				If the emotes are not enough, you can post your own images in the chat like so :
				say [url:&lt;link&gt;]
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477807432211/7DE573D3289E360B029899141E4C659D7859C604/" title="Images">

				</a>
				<br>
				I would recommend using imgur's simple and intuitive system to store your images. Wether the extension is <b>gif png jpg or jpeg</b>

			</div>
			<div class="in">
				<h1>Sprays</h1>
				The server uses <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=french&id=394091909" target="_blank">Spraymesh</a>
				spraymesh_help in console for more details on the subject.
				spraymesh_url &lt;link&gt; is a simple way of changing your spray,
				spraymesh_manager avoids using the above command everytime you want to change your spray.
				<br>
				<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477808848844/678D01DD2CBF4209B0ECD74D947754A93746B3D8/" title="Sprays">

				</a>
				<br>
				I also recommend using <b>imgur</b> for your spray links,
				although you will need to use <b>giphy</b> to have a sprayeable gif.
