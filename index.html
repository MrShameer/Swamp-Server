    			Swamp Cinema is a casual, social gamemode where players hang out in a virtual movie theater and watch videos. On ours, there's lots of fun stuff to do outside of the theaters. Start a game of chess, checkers, golf, or dodgeball. Or save up your pointshop points, pick up some weapons, and start a war!

    			rarely be able to vote-skip videos due to the sheer amount of players in this theater.

    			<h2>The Knife Pit</h2>
    			<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1494586001114626137/B752C9D2208951337424F4916EBE87F3584BAA7E/" title="Knife Pit">

    			<a class="img" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/780728477808355697/073531B6A3281512AD002541E4692372A236C34F/" title="Moon">

    		Swamp Cinema requires a few steps to be done first to ensure full functionality.
    		<div class="in">
    			<h1>Initial Steps</h1>
    			You need to make sure that you are on the x86-64 - Chromium + 64-bit binaries beta for Garry's Mod and that the Garry's Mod: CEF Codec Fix is applied to your game.

				The steps to do this are listed by pressing F2 while on the server.

    			</a>
    			<br>
    		</div>
    		<div class="in">
    			<h1>Queuing Videos</h1>
    			Once those 2 steps correctly done, the server will offer you so many possibilities
				that you will probably not find elsewhere, in terms of watching videos on a gmod server.

				These options involve YouTube's entire spectrum of functionalities including it's HTML5 videos and YouTube livestreams.

				(Thanks to the codecs patch made by WinterPhoenix96, who is known to be the Lead Developer behind the Yuki Cinema Server)

				If these are not enough, there are also possibilities of queuing videos from different hosting services such as:

				-Twitch,
				-Dropbox,
				-RTMP servers.
